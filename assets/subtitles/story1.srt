00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,599
the lion the mouse and the sleepy bear

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,280
once upon a time

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,720
in a lush forest there lived a small

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
mouse there was a huge bear who lived in

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
a neighboring cave the big bear who had

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
hibernated months ago

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
was still sleeping and snoring loudly

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
the little mouse went to him one day to

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,960
wake the bear up because he could not

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,120
sleep all winter

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,360
due to the bear's noisy snoring

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,680
mr bear

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,239
hey mr bear hey

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,200
summer has come you can wake up any time

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,320
now however the bear still did not wake

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
up the little mouse came to the bear

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,520
this time with a bugle he blew

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,199
vigorously into the bugle

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
but the bear continued to sleep

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
while the little mouse was wandering

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
sleeplessly in the forest he met several

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
animal friends what happened little

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
mouse why are you sad oh

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,600
don't ask guys all winter i could not

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
sleep because of the bears snoring and

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,479
he still won't wake up

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,759
hmm

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,960
maybe the lion can help you

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,759
what

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,479
why would i go talk to him

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,079
because the lion roars so loud that

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,880
everyone jumps up the instant i hear his

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
loud voice

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
though the little mouse was a little

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
scared by the thought

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
he went to the lion the king of the

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
forest to request his assistance the

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
lion was sleeping in front of his cave

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,200
the little mouse was terrified when he

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,439
saw the mighty beast so he decided to

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,680
give up his plan and go back home but

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
when he accidentally stepped on a branch

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,479
in front of him the big cat woke up and

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,239
a tiny trembling voice reached his ears

47
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
what's that noise what are you doing in

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,560
front of my cave

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
um

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,400
well the king of the forest

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
sorry to wake you up

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
well

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,760
came to ask for your help you're not

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
even big enough to be considered snack

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
size little mouse why should i help you

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,480
dear fearsome lion you have to wake up

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
my neighbor the big bear who won't wake

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
up from hibernation

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,200
nothing i do seems to wake him since i'm

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
small i have a little voice

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,480
but one roar from you can solve

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
everything

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,720
i don't have time to spend for a tiny

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,760
little useless mouse like you i am king

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
of the forest

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,480
the lion walked away without helping the

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
mouse he went to a corner where no one

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
could see him he leaned against a tree

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,440
and started to itch like crazy

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,400
[Music]

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,879
the lion was so itchy that he didn't

73
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
want anyone to see him like this

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,120
because he was the king of the forest

75
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
the little mouse on the other hand was

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,319
coming home sadly and heard wheezing

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,599
from the depths of the forest

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,080
he went where the voice came from and he

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,959
saw the lion moreover the lion was

80
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,680
itching himself non-stop and looking

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
rather silly in the process the mouse

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
immediately approached the lion when the

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
lion saw him he stopped itching but it

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
was clear he was still in pain and

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
discomfort due to the itch mr lyon what

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,319
happened to you

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,599
i don't know mouse i don't know

88
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,840
i can't stop itching myself

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
you haven't seen or heard anything mouse

90
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,959
are we clear

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,159
the mouse carefully fixed his tiny eyes

92
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
on the lion and saw a bunch of tiny

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,918
fleas

94
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,120
jumping in his fur the mouse understood

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
why the mighty cat was itching so much

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,759
oh

97
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,320
you have fleas let me help you

98
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
how can you help me you're just a little

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,479
mouse

100
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,600
leave me alone

101
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,759
the little mouse bravely jumped on him

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,080
ignoring the lion's rude comments

103
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
[Music]

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
what are you doing

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
get off of me the mouse started to crawl

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,360
through the thick scruffy fur and throw

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
out all the fleas

108
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
but this made the lions situation even

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,639
worse

110
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,880
he started itching himself with his paws

111
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
the lion could not bear the itch and

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
leaned his back against the tree this

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,280
time he started to rub right and left oh

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,639
no

115
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
i was almost crushed

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
i can't stop i can't stop the more you

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,440

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,360
sir

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
the lion ran to a nearby lake he quickly

120
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
jumped into the water

121
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
the mouse on his back was nearly drowned

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
mr lion get out of the water right away

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
or i'll drown

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
the lion came out of the lake but then

125
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
proceeded to shake himself dry he was

126
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,479
shaking his body so hard and so fast

127
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,560
that the mouse barely was able to hang

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
on to that thoughtless lion i've almost

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,600
got the edge taken care of mr lion

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,880
just a little bit more to the left

131
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,080
the lion

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
finally stopped himself

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
the mouse threw out the last few fleas

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
that remained on the lion

135
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
how do you feel now

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,400
well

137
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,280
it's like my itching is gone

138
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,000
because i have cleaned all the fleas for

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
you sir the lion was very embarrassed

140
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
with how rude he was

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
when you asked for help i looked down on

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
you mouse

143
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
but you still did everything in your

144
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,240
power to save me from this difficult

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000

hop on my back and i'll take you home

148
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,560
when the little mouse and the big lion

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,800
arrived at the mouse's home they heard

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,919
loud snoring sounds flooding out of the

151
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
big bear's cave

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,599
huh what's that noise

153
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,800
they then

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,599
entered the cave

155
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,479
ah

156
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639

summer has come

158
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,160
the big bear is still sleeping the lion

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
the king of the forest took a deep

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,039
breath and roared so powerfully

161
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,919
right into the ears of the big bear

162
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,880
that the stone floor of his cave shook

163
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
thanks to this powerful roar the bear

164
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
finally woke up and ran out of the cave

165
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,599
[Music]

166
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240

where is it well all the forest animals

170
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
laughed at the big silly bear

171
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
little mouse was also very happy that

172
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,240
the snoring was finally over
