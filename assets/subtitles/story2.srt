00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,240
The Ugly Duckling

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,560
On a beautiful summer day, a family of ducks
is taking a swim while another is enjoying

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,960
a stroll by the bank.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,530
But one duck is sitting on her eggs among
the tall leaves.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,880
I wonder when my babies are going to come
out.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,440
They are taking so long to hatch!

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,680
It is so lonely, no one has the time to visit
me.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,220
But Mommy duck didn’t have to wait too long.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,369
Soon the eggs started cracking and the little
ducklings started taking small unsteady steps

10
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:31,369
out of the shells.

11
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,190
Quack quack, quack quack.

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,810
Oooh, my babies are so beautiful!

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,510
Now come and line up here all of you.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,940
One..Two..Three..Four…Five..Hey, there should
be one more.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,800
Mother duck looked around, and saw one egg
which had not yet hatched

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,570
I think I will have to sit again on this egg
till it hatches.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,570
It seems pretty large.

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,100
Soon the last egg hatched, but the duckling
that crept out was large and ugly.

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,280
This little fellow doesn’t look like his
brothers and sisters.

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,140
The next day, Mother Duck leads her brood
to the water.

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Oh!

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,250
I am proud today that my ducklings are swimming
so well!

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,119
And how well the youngest one is swimming.

24
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,270
Come on kids, that’s enough for today.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,369
We must get to the farm before it turns dark.

26
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,810
The duck family makes its way to the farmhouse,
where there are lots of other ducks.

27
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,570
What is that strange looking creature doing
here?

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,200
The other ducklings are so cute but this one
is so big and ugly.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,759
He is ugly.

30
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,740
We don’t want him here.

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,430
That’s not a nice thing to say.

32
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,249
He is still small, and I’m sure he will
grow up to be beautiful too.

33
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:52,280
But the other ducklings continued to bully
and make fun of the ugly duckling.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,350
I hope the ducklings stop this nonsense.

35
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,539
I can’t bear to see that poor child looking
so sad.

36
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:05,110
But as days went by, things started becoming
worse for the ugly duckling.

37
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,799
Wherever he went, everyone was mean to him.

38
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,940
Have you ever seen anything uglier than this?

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Uff!

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,600
Seeing this creature in the morning, my day
will also be as ugly as he is.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Ha..Ha…he seems to be getting uglier by
the day.

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,870
The Ugly Duckling just wanted to hide somewhere
and cry.

43
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,890
Even his brothers and sisters were rude to
him.

44
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,890
Don’t come near us.

45
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,890
Go away!

46
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,890
I wish the cat comes and takes you.

47
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,190
Mother Duck was very sad to see everyone treat
the ugly ducking so badly.

48
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,030
Nobody wants to talk to me or play with me
because I am ugly.

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,840
I will run away from here.

50
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,500
So the ugly duckling flew over the fence of
the farmyard, and continued flying till he

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,650
spotted a large moor.

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,320
He decided to spend the night there.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,850
I am so tired.

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,150
I think I will spend the night here.

55
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,930
Next morning, the ugly duckling woke up to
the sound of loud quacking.

56
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,030
He opened his eyes and saw a flock of wild
ducks.

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,600
Who are you?

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,280
Can I please stay here for a while?

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,650
I have nowhere to go.

61
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,620
You are ugly….(a long pause) Stay here,
but don’t get in our way.

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,800
The Ugly Duckling stayed on the moor for a
few days.

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,580
He felt lonely, but no one bullied him or
hurt him because of his looks.

64
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,350
One morning, the duckling heard a noise like
a big bang.

65
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,310
He lay still, too scared to move.

66
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,730
When he finally lifted his head and looked
around, all the other ducks had fled.

67
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,400
The ugly duckling also fled from the moor
as fast as it could.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,960
It flew as fast as its young wings would take
him.

69
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,760
However, suddenly there was thunder and lightning,
scaring the little duckling.

70
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Brrr.

71
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,510
I am so wet and cold.

72
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,960
That cottage there looks warm, maybe I can
take shelter there.

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,570
The cottage belonged to an old lady, who lived
with with her tomcat and hen, who found the

74
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,950
duckling the next morning.

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,680
Cluck cluck, meow meow
What is happening here?

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,200
Why are you making so much noise?

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,730
What is this we have here?

78
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,380
Looks like a duck, though a very ugly one.

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,040
I know what I will do.

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,650
I will keep it with me and wait for it to
lay eggs.

81
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,890
Then I will have eggs from my hen and from
this duck too.

82
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:25,449
Ah, but I do hope this is a duck and not a
drake.

83
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,199
So the ugly duckling stayed with the old lady
in her cottage.

84
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,860
But here also, the tomcat and the hen made
its life so miserable!

85
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,470
Hey you, don’t you get scared when you see
your face in the mirror?

86
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,550
Look at me.

87
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,979
My coat is so silky.

88
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,240
Look at my whiskers, so long and beautiful.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,400
The mistress says my walk is so graceful.

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,790
You are such a loser.

91
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,880
You cannot even lay an egg!

92
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,909
Look at my eggs, such lovely big and brown
ones.

93
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,120
The ugly duckling continued to be lonely.

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,300
He would sit in front of the window looking
at the small pond outside.

95
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,590
How I wish I could swim in that pond.

96
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,169
It used to be so nice when I swam in the cool
water back home.

97
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,340
Are you mad?

98
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,210
The mistress is not going to let you go.

99
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,740
You have a safe house, what more do you want?

100
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,949
Behave yourself and don’t anger the mistress,
the cat, or even me.

101
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,600
Want to swim, indeed!

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,710
The ugly duckling felt very, very sad, wondering
what to do.

103
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:34,241
I know this place is safe, but I feel like
a prisoner here, being punished by not being

104
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,240
allowed to swim.

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,960
I want to swim – I want to be free to swim
and fly as I please.

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,860
I have to escape from here somehow.

107
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,389
So one night, the duckling quietly crept out
of the cottage and went in search of a new

108
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,389
home.

109
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:53,029
Soon he found a beautiful lake where he could
swim and dive.

110
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,029
Ahhhhh!

111
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:58,629
(Splash) This is such a lovely place.

112
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:02,569
It feels so good to swim after so long.

113
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:08,680
I hope the other animals and birds here are
friendly so I don’t have to move away from

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,719
here also.

115
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,139
But alas, here too the other animals did not
want to be friends with the ugly duckling.

116
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,680
Why does everybody keep avoiding me?

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,500
Just because I am ugly, it doesn’t mean
everyone has to be mean!

118
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,270
No one wants to play with me or even talk
to me!

119
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,419
So life continued in this miserabke way for
the ugly duckling.

120
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,289
Soon, the seasons changed.

121
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:36,409
Autumn set in, and the colour of the leaves
changed from red to orange and then gold.

122
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,580
Winter followed.

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,370
The forest turned white, and a very cold wind
set in.

124
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,270
The dark clouds made the duckling feeling
even more gloomy and sad, so the duckling

125
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,900
decided to go to the lakeside.

126
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,020
And what a lovely sight he saw there!

127
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,240
What are these beautiful birds?

128
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,620
I don’t think I have seen them before.

129
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,159
How beautifully they spread their large wings!

130
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:02,199
It looks like they are not flying but just
gliding through the sky.

131
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,129
Though the winter grew colder and colder,
the duckling continued to swim despite the

132
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,479
freezing water, and then finally took refuge
in some bushes.

133
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,900
Finally, it was spring again.

134
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,439
Plants started sprouting and the sun peeped
down from the sky.

135
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,300
The duckling was so happy that it was becoming
warm again.

136
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,800
Everything around me has become so beautiful.

137
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,810
My wings have also become strong and I can
now swim in the pond close by.

138
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,199
Suddenly, the duckling once again saw the
same beautiful birds that he had seen at the

139
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,359
start of spring, and quickly ran and hid behind
some bushes.

140
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Those birds are so beautiful.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,020
I better not go near them, or they too will
make fun of me.

142
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,759
I am so scared that they might even kill me!

143
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:51,300
I am so tired of being picked on by everybody,
first the ducklings at the farm, my own brothers

144
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,259
and sisters, the hen and tomcat at the cottage,
and everybody else.

145
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,529
I wish I had never been born!

146
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,259
(Sob sob sob.)

147
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:05,899
The duckling went to a quiet spot on the lake
where nobody could see him.

148
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,960
He was very, very sad, and big fat tears rolled
down its face.

149
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,720
Suddenly, the duckling saw its own reflection
in the lake, and couldn’t believe its eyes!

150
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,490
For staring at him in the clear water below
was his own reflection, no longer a dark,

151
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,249
grey bird, ugly and repulsive to look at.

152
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:27,449
Instead, he had turned into a graceful and
beautiful swan.

153
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,289
The ugly duckling had transformed into a beautiful
swan!!

154
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,760
All the other swans came to greet the newcomer,
and stroked his neck with their beaks.

155
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,959
Finally, the ugly little thing was accepted
and loved by his new friends, to whom he belonged,

156
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,620
the beautiful and graceful swans.

157
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,760
A family with two children came to see the
swans swimming.

158
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,100
Look, there is a new one.

159
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,230
Father, mother, come here, there is another
swan.

160
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,180
A new one has arrived.”

161
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,690
The new one is the most beautiful of all.

162
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,170
Oh, he is so young and pretty!

163
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,980
The swan did not know how to react to so much
praise.

164
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,610
He felt shy and tried to hide his face.

165
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,600
After being mocked and taunted and bullied
for so long, he couldn’t believe he was

166
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,750
being appreciated and accepted!

167
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,940
And he was actually being called beautiful!

168
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,990
I never dreamt that I would see a day when
someone would call me beautiful!

169
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,250
I wish I had received the same love and affection
when I was the little and ugly creature, I

170
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,940
wouldn’t have spent such a sad childhood.

171
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,029
Why do people treat others according to their
looks?

172
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,660
That is so, so sad!
